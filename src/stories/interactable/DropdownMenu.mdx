# Dropdown menu

A dropdown menu is an interactive user interface element that allows users to select from a list of options.
It typically appears as a vertical list that expands when the user clicks or taps on a specific control.
Dropdown menus are used to conserve space and enhance user experience by presenting a variety of options
in a compact manner. They provide a quick and efficient way for users to make a selection or
take an action without requiring much screen real estate.
